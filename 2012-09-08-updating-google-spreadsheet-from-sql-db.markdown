title: Updating a google spreadsheet from an sql database using a python script

A common problem I have is getting the output of my queries to google spreadsheets.
So I had an odesk contractor create a python script for me that does exactly that:

It gets as input 
* database connection information
* a query
* a pointer to a google spreadsheet

and it goes ahead executes the query fetches the data and "pastes" them on the google spreadsheet.

Here is the [script file](db2google.py)
